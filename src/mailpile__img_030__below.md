### Organizing Your Sidebar

<div class="lightblue_frame">**TIP:**

- After clicking ***Organize*** close to the lower left corner of the GUI, you can click and drag any of the tags (Inbox, Outbox, etc.) up or down to change its order in the sidebar.[^organizing_learnLink]
- Click ***Done*** when you have finished.
</div>

This doesn't seem to work with [nested tags](#nestedTags). <span class="fluo_orange_bgnd">**[needs clarification]**</span>

[^organizing_learnLink] How did I learn that?
  
    By clicking a "learn" link about that when *Mailpile* kindly offered it to me in the notifications box:
  
    > Mailpile lets you organize your mailbox the way you want it to be.  
    > You can start customizing your experince by rearranging the sidebar on the left.
    >
    >    - In the bottom left, click: ***Organize***.
    >    - From here you can click and drag any of the tags (Inbox, Outbox, etc.) up or down to change its order in the sidebar.
    >    - To customize each tag individually, click on one of the gears next to any tag.
    >        - Under Tag Settings you can change the name and color of a tag as well as where it's located and if you want it in your searches.
    >        - Under Technical Settings you can make sub-tags so that they're more organized. For example:
    >        - Receipts
    >            - Bills
    >            - Groceries
    >            - Personal
    >            - Work
    >
    > Stay tuned for more helpful hints to guide you in customizing your Mailpile!


We'll see [later](#EditingTagsSettings) in this document how to edit tags settings.
