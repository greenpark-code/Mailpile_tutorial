Simply:

1. select the messages by marking their checkboxes on the right
2. click the Trash icon

This is common practice in the interface of various webmail services.

**The following tasks are all very easy in *Mailpile*:**

- enabling definitive deletion of emails
- emptying the trash
- immediately and permanently delete a specific message which is out of the trash or in it
- setting a lower number of days of permanence of emails in the trash before automatic definitive deletion (the default is 91 days)

You'd better understand the instructions after reading other parts of this tutorial, but you can jump directly [there](#deletingEmails) now if you need to.
