## Nested tags (subtags)

I have now created two tags nested in the ***Reddit*** one.

(Actually, in this moment I am *simulating* that I have a use case for subtags.  
In reality, *each one* of those emails contains notifications from *various* groups. I'll delete those subtags later.)

**NOTICE: subtags can have a different color from their parent.**  
I chose the same on purpose.

I'm going to click each subtag in the sidebar, and then their parent.
