I have clicked the ***Inbox*** link almost at the top of the sidebar and I see that I have no untagged messages.  

<a name="ComposingAndSendingAnEmail"></a>

## Composing and sending an email

Now I'd like to compose and send a message. I'm going to click **the pen icon above towards the right**.  
In this case, in my Inbox completely empty, I could also click the ***Compose a message*** button.
