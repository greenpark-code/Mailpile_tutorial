## Removing tags from emails

Here are a few ways to remove tags from emails:

- See the picture below: hovering the mouse cursor on an email tag reveals a contextual menu through which we can edit the tag or remove it from that email.
- When you select one or more emails by marking their checkboxes on the right, the rightmost icon in the upper toolbar enables to completely untag that email.
- The [CLI](#Mailpile_CLI) enables to very quickly [remove and add tags](#TaggingUntaggingUsingTheCLI).
- Of course, moving one or more emails from tag A to tag B removes tag A from them and adds tag B.
