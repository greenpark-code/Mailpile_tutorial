For the emails above, inside the parent tag, the subtags icons now appear as if they were attributes.

However:  
<div class="fluo_green_frame">**Defining subtags as attributes is not necessary. Any parent tag will show the contents of all its nested tags.**  
(We might think of it as a special case of cross-folders search.)
</div>

Here, I have actually left them configured as categories.  
[Below](#subtagsAsAttributes), I'm also changing them to attributes.
