## Backup of *Mailpile* settings


<div class="lightblue_frame">**TIP:** You should *always* click this ***Backup*** button **after modifying your settings or creating new keys**  
You should also make a backup copy of your **~/.gnupg** folder, or whatever folder you have symlinked as **~/.gnupg**

'~' expands to '/home/username/' or '/root/', it's the user's home folder in *Linux*, I don't know where the *Windows* version of *GnuPG* keeps that folder.
