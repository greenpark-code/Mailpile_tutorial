### (Tag Automation)

I'm also showing you the ***Automation*** section, which I'm not using in this tutorial.

It should enable me to establish an action which would automatically take place a certain amount of days after tagging an email, choosing among:

- **Remove from this tag**
- **Move to Inbox**
- **Move to Trash**
- **Delete e-mails**

Below is the default setup: disabled.
