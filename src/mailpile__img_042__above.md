I'm going to check if the file is now in the ~/Downloads folder, which is where *Firefox* is configured to save files on my PC.[^option-aUnnecessary]

[^option-aUnnecessary] Off topic: `ls -l Mailpile*` would have been a more strictly appropriate command, since the `-a` option is only needed to also list files which names starts by a dot, otherwise "invisible" (apparently, I've made a habit of checking them out as well). `-l` shows the file size (and permissions).
