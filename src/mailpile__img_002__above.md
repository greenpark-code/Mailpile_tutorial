By default, *Mailpile* launches my web browser to be used as the Graphical User Interface.[^opensBrowserByDefault]


<div class="fluo_green_frame">The fact that our **web browser** is used as the GUI empowers us to have **various tabs open and connected to *Mailpile* at the same time, in order to keep going with various tasks**. For instance, I could be preparing an email while searching in others or checking if any new incoming emails need an urgent replay.
</div>


[^opensBrowserByDefault] This behavior can be modified in the settings. [You might prefer](#separateFirefoxInstance) to open you browser by yourself, or use a previously open instance of it.


Notice the URL: **[localhost:33411](http://localhost:33411/)**

"localhost" means that the web browser itself is connected to *Mailpile* which is running *locally* on my own machine, this browser tab does not connect directly to a remote server.

*Mailpile* in turn is connecting to the remote servers of my email service providers, if possible, or it is enabling me to **work on my emails in local storage, while staying offline**.
