I'm going to do it now and move that email to the ***Reddit*** tag.

<div class="lightblue_frame">**TIP:** had I already created *various* tags, at this point I might make a mistake and move the email to the wrong tag, thus "losing sight" of that email. In that case, I could <u>**either**</u>:

1. search for words that I've seen in the email subject or body, by mean of the search engine, which is accessible
    - in the upper portion of the GUI
    - through the Command Line Interface, in this case for instance `search interesting code`\<enter\>  
    (this document includes [a section](#Mailpile_CLI) showing how to search and export emails or search and delete emails with the Command Line Interface.).  
    
    <u>**or**</u>
    
2. click the ***All Mail*** link just above the lower left corner and look there for the message.  
   The ***All Mail*** link will show us all messages of all accounts regardless what categories we moved them to or attributes we associated them to.
