<a name="password"></a>I'm asked to type a password. Afterwards, the same password will be *necessary* to unlock the whole setup with my settings and emails.

It can actually be a passphrase made of various words separated by spaces. *Mailpile* itself suggests a sequence of words, I prefer to *create my own sequence* some of which modified from any vocabulary (avoiding obvious substitutions which would be part of hackers' dictionaries anyway), including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. After checking that no smartphone cameras or webcams are around, **I write it down on paper first (no cameras around) and type it in afterwards, and keep the paper somewhere safe during the first few days.** (The same when I [change](#changePassword) it.)

But you might have other methods.

**Just don't lose or forget it!**
