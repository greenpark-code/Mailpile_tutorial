# Back to our hands-on session

As I've chosen for this tutorial to let *Mailpile* create and manage my keys, I won't have to type the keys passphrase (and/or touch any sensor button on a hardware device).

## Accessing an email account

I'm ready to type this email account password, the password I normally type in when accessing my emails in this account.

By **default**, *Mailpile* **temporarily remembers** this password, so I won't have to type it in again **during this session**.

The drop-down menu (call it listbox if you prefer) where you can read "Unlock Account" enables me to choose other behaviors. I could prefer to let *Mailpile* permanently remember my password for that account (and possibly in the future easily tell it to forget it, [**Incoming Mail settings**](#IncomingMailSettings) | ***Forget password***.
