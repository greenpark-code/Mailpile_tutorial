## More accounts

I get to the following screen, where the **+ *Add Account*** link enables me to add as many accounts as I need.

Here I have already added a second account.  

Basically, for each account, I had to:

+ type in the name and email address of the account
+ choose the type and management of encryption keys
+ type in the password I always use to access the account

With *Vivaldi* (vivaldi.net), I didn't have to modify any settings from what *Mailpile* had been suggested by Vivaldi's autoconfig server.

See [below](#MailpileWithGMail) for *Google Mail*.
